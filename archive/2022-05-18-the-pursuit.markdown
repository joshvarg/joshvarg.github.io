I'm not really a person of habits or routine. Most of my daily actions are dictated by what feels right in the moment or if I feel motivated enough to do something. While it's somewhat worked for me so far, this past year has really shown me the problems with this sort of workstyle and living. So in an effort to introduce some sort of routine and daily motivation I'm starting this blog.

So what is The Pursuit? Aside from being an extremely cringey name, it's essentially my personal mission; to do what I can to learn something new every day.[^1] Or in other words, "the pursuit of knowledge". It's my hope that not only will this establish a new habit, but it'll give me a productive challenge to look forward to every day.

To make it as authentic as possible I'm also going to lay some ground rules for myself:

1. No backspace allowed.

	When I was in elementary school I had a teacher that would make us write reflections. In order to truly write what was on our mind at the time, we weren't allowed to erase, or even pick up our pencils. I like to think that this practice will make me a more purposeful writer over time, but also let myself not take this too seriously.

2. Write something.

	Even if I feel as though nothing technical or quantitative was learned, everyone learns something new every day. Just take a little time to reflect and write about it.

3. Don't think about who's reading.

	I definitely wish I was smarter or wrote better than I actually do. Some of that has even influenced the writing on this very post (like me using that semi-colon earlier, was that even correct).[^2] However if I keep this rule in mind, it'll free me to be more true to my actual thought process, and in turn, help me in the learning process.

4. Plan ahead.

	I can foresee the problem in which I feel too busy to make a new post, but if I plan ahead with what I want to learn it'll make this issue so much easier to resolve.

And with that last rule I have tomorrow's goals: theming jekyll and learning markdown.

Goodnight ðŸŒ™
