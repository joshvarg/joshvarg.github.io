I don't love XCode. Sorry I lied in the title. This app or IDE or whatever it is, is the slowest editing I've ever done. Maybe I'm just used to vim but man this experience sucked. My computer is also pretty old so that could be it but all I'm saying is that this is the first time typing something has actually lagged on my computer. Truly incredible. With that being said I actually enjoy the Swift language. There seems to be a lot of in-built methods and libraries for dealing with iOS applications which just makes everything much easier. The only issue I was really having was that it's hard to search what I am trying to implement since everything is based visually and doesn't have really precise language. For instance I was trying to implement a plus button that would act as adding a new activity, but on pressing the button it would slide down a little 'New Activity' form with appropriate fields. To this hour the closest I found was a hamburger menu which I figured I could just repurpose and reorient as coming from the top of the screen rather than the side.

I just realized that I never even talked about how this related to the previous goal I had. I wanted to track all my actions and activities throughout the day and so I decided rather than just write it down on Obsidian (my notes app), I would build an app that could do it for me and maybe even analyze some data at the end of the week. Of course the only problem being I had never touched Swift and me and XCode already had beef because it takes up so much gosh darn space on my computer. Despite this I learned a lot about Swift and in particular, views, and their relation within ContentView file. I managed to make a small proof-of-concept about what I wanted as you can see to the right. It's not much to look at but it's more than I have ever done when it comes to app development so I think I did a pretty decent job for now. I'm giving myself a deadline of two more days on this project before I'm finished with it so tomorrow's going to be mostly focused on data persistence and hopefully on Monday I can make it look legit.

If this sounds rushed it's because it is I did not actually have a lot of time to work on things today and I should definitely be sleeping right now.

Goodnight üåô
