Most of today's work revolved around data persistence and being able to keep my Activity objects stored somewhere on the app. I learned about how iOS creates a sandbox for all its data files so that they can be deleted cleanly without interacting with the greater system. This is different from something like macOS applications which has full access to the rest of the filesystem.

CoreData is Apple's persistence framework that seems to be integrated with Swift applications and XCode itself. I created an Activites model, with an Activity entity, controllers, and an extender for further method descriptions. I feel close to getting a real working application that I could potentially install on my phone, with the last part being something called AppDelegate? or AppDelegation? I don't really remember what it was called but it looked confusing and I'm pretty sure it has to do with instructing on what to preload or instantiate before launching the application. Tomorrow I hope to finish that and start working on making the app look decent. Might even add some pie charts to show how much time I'm wasting on Twitter.

## Introspection

The title is a bit of a double entendre because I'm not only talking about data persistence but being persistent in my own life and process of learning. It's only been a couple of days and yet I can feel that I am spending less and less time actually working on these projects and this project in particular. Now that may just be because there have been other things I had to attend to these past few days and never really had good blocks of free time, but part of me thinks that it's my inherent rejection to routine. Regardless of what it is, I am really trying to build something here in which can last me for the rest of my life, and at the minimum, my last school year. That may sound kind of dramatic but the truth is I am unfathomably bad at creating habits and a good routine and I really do think its been detrimental to my success in general. Plus what's the harm in actively learning something every day?

Goodnight ðŸŒ™
